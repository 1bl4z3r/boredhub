This a brand new repo, to store everything I do, when I'm hella bored; hence the name. I will try to make multi-languages, but no guarantees, much like my boredom...

|NAME|DESCRIPTION|
|---|---|
|timezone.py|Timezone is a small script that converts time amongst IST,UTC and CET. This uses argparse to get commands on which             timezone you will be entering time in and converts to other zones. It uses pytz to accurately convert amongst the timezones. Additionally, without entering any time, it will take system time and convert it, but the conversion will be continous manner, so you will always get converted time in your console.|
|stress.bat|It is a simple batch file to test limits of your CPU, by opening multiple instances of tree. Or, you can use to show off your "Hackerman" self, or prank your less tech-savvy friends, I simply don't care.|
